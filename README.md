# Welcome to Averager!

A app to find averages.


# Download

Git clone or download a zip of the repo!

## Run

Just run main.py. Simple.

## How to use
It is self explanatory. First press enter to start the app. Then enter each number you want to take average of ( seperated by spaces without commas ).

## Conclusion
I, as the developer of Averager, know that there are some issues that can be fixed ( like the ability to seperate numbers by commas ). So I appreciate any pull requests and I will accept the pull request as soon as possible.
